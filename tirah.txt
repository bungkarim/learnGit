I know she's so pretty, kind, polite, supportive, and emphatic. But I also know that I'm just a low class man.
I have no job right now, have not graduated from my college. Shortly, my life is still messy.
I don't know if I can approach her (again) an make her attracted to me.
But, the good news is: "I have already ready to lose the opportunity to be with her".
I still have a dream, a big dream.
And I'm going to stick with it, do all my best to make it happen.
